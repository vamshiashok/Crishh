My father is a (occupation) which is very difficult to make more money only depends upon the source.
I still remember everyday he used to teach me the value of one rupee. How it leads the happier or Cursefull life. 
He gives very respect to each and every moment of life.
I personally learn from him if you  spend an hour time  on our goal we can achieve something in it. 
In the same way if we spend that time for unusual or unprofitable things we may miss something. 
Because of my fatherâ€™s profession, there is a chance to me to develop my personality well. In my entire life, he is my great inspiration. 
He is my guide. The things what I have learnt  from my father might be helpful to me to enhance my professional skills which are excellently fit for your organization.
