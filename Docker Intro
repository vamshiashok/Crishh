Docker is used for cost minimization.
Instead of creating multiple instances for the each service, we can create the one server and we create the containers in that.
Instead of creating multiple servers, with in a one server we can create containers. 

Container:- It is like a virtual machine and it does not have any OS.

Vitualization:- Process that allows for more efficient utilization of physical computer hardware and is the foundation of cloud computing.

Docker Host:- Docker host is the machine where you installed the docker image.
Docker Daemon:- Docker Daemonn runs on the host OS. It is responsible for running containers to manage docker services.
