Docker is used for cost minimization.
Instead of creating multiple instances for the each service, we can create the one server and we create the containers in that.
Instead of creating multiple servers, with in a one server we can create containers. 

Container:- It is like a virtual machine and it does not have any OS.

Vitualization:- Process that allows for more efficient utilization of physical computer hardware and is the foundation of cloud computing.

Hypervisor:- Help to make virtualization and create a Vitual Machine(VM).

Containerization:- Process of packing application along with its dependencies.

Docker: It is a tool that create this container. It is advance than virtualization.

-> It is designed to create, deploy and run applications.
-> Docker is written on go language.
-> Docker uses container on host OS to run applications.
-> We can install docker on any OS but docker engine natively runs on linux distribution.
-> Docker performs OS level virtualization also known as Containerization.

Docker Client:- It is the primary way that many docker users interact with Docker.
Docker Host:- Docker host is the machine where you installed the docker image.
Docker Daemon:- Docker Daemonn runs on the host OS. It is responsible for running containers to manage docker services.

Docker Commands:
-------------------
$yum install docker -y (To install Docker)
$systemctl restart docker.service (To start the service)
$systemctl status docker.service
Get ubuntu docker image as ($docker pull ubuntu)
$docker images (To check how many images are there in the docker engine)
$docker ps (To list out all the containers) (It displays only the running containers)
$docker ps -a (To list all the containers installed including stopped containers too)
If we use docker pull it only installs the image, but if we use the $docker run ubuntu , it will also creates the container in the engine.
$docker search jenkins (To search for an Image in the docker hub)
If you pull an image from docker hub, it is only install the docker image , if you have to create a container on that image
$docker run -it ubuntu
To check the container belongs to which image ($cat /etc/os-release)
$docker ps -a (To list all the containers) 
To change the default name for the container ($docker run -it --name crish ubuntu)
To change the command for container ($docker run -it --name crish ubuntu /bin/bash)
To start a docker container ($docker start <container_name>)
To enter into the container ($docker attach <container_name)
You can only attach to the container only when it is in start state.
$docker stop <container_name> (To stop the container)
