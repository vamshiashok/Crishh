DevOps
------
DevOps is a culture that allows the development and the operations team to work together. 
This results in continuous development, testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle.

GIT
-----
GIT it is a Distrubuted Version Control System or Source Code Management Tool by providing data assurance for developing quality software.
-> Repositories
-> Work Space
-> Staging Area
-> Commits
-> Issues and Pull Requests

VCS:- It is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time 
      so that you can recall specific versions later.


Repository
-------------
It is a directory or a storage space where your projects can live.
It can be a local to a folder on you computer or 
It can be a storage space on another online host (Such as GITHUB).

$git init (To initialize the GIT)
$git add <file_name> (To add files from the working area to the staging area)
$git commit -m "Comment about the commit" <file_name> (To commit the files from staging area to local )
$git push (To move the files from local to remote server)
$git status (Check the status of the GIT files)
$git clone (Used to download the remote repository to the local)
$git pull ( Used to fetch and download the content from a remote repository 
            and immediately update the local repository to match that content)
$git checkout -b <branch_name> (To create a new branch and enter into it)
$git checkout <branch_name> (To move from one branch to another)
$git fork (You can create a copy of the original repo on your local machine or GITHUB profile)
$git log (We can track all the commits have been done)
$git cherry-pick (If there are n no.of commits, to pick a commit from those we use cherrypick by using commit ID
                  git cherry-pick in git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another branch. )

$git merge & git rebase 
both commands are used to merge the files from the other branches to the main branch , 
but when we use the git merge the commits goes to the top in the git log, while rebase will be not prioritized.

Linux
---------
Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system's hardware and resources, 
like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.

Linux is known for its stability, security, flexibility, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for DevOps practices.
