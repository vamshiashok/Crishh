Jenkins
----------
CI -> Continuous Integration (Integration- adding/combining)
CD -> Continuous Delivery/Deployment

CI = Code -> Build -> Test -> Integration 
CD = Code -> Build -> Test -> Integration -> QA or UAT(User Acceptance Test)
Doing all the process as automation called as Continuous Deployment

Pipeline:- Step by step execution
-> Version Control(Github)
-> Build 
-> Unit Test
-> Deploy
-> Auto test
-> Deploy to production
-> Measure + Validate

Jenkins:
--------
-> Jenkins is a open source project written in java that runs on windows, linux, macOS.
-> Consists of plugins (By using plugins we can automate the process)
-> Whenever developers write code, we integrate all the code of all developers at any point of time and we build, test and deliver/deploy to client. This is called CI/CD.

Workflow of Jenkins:
--------------------
-> We can attach Git, Maven, selenium and Artifactory plugins to the jenkins.
-> Once developer put the code in github jenkins pull the code and send to maven for build.
-> Once build is done, jenkins pull that code and send it to selenium for testing.
-> Once testing is done, jenkins pull that code and send to Artifactory as per requirement.
-> We can also deploy with jenkins.
