If there are n no.of commits, to pick a commit from those we use cherrypick by using commit ID


git cherry-pick in git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another branch. 
This is in contrast with other ways such as merge and rebases which normally apply many commits into another branch. 
git cherry-pick is just like rebasing, an advanced concept and also a powerful command.
